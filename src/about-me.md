# About me

I began my journey into the computer science world when I was finishing university during the pandemic. I discovered my love for making lightweight websites and my love for blockchains shortly after.

I completed my Bachelor of Science in Business concentrating in Supply Chain Management and Analytics from VCU's School of Business and a Minor in Mathematics in May 2021. I made Dean's List in August 2020 and May 2021.

In October 2021, I discovered buildspace through Developer DAO. This led me to my first frontend contract and then a short gig as a teaching assistant with [buildspace](https://buildspace.so). Next, I worked full-time as a Developer Relations Engineer at [Ankr](https://ankr.com).

I'm also hanging out in [Developer DAO](https://developerdao.com) and [Peeple DAO](https://peeple.work/).
