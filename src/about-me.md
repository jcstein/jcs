# About me

I began my journey into the development world when I was finishing university during the pandemic. I discovered my love for making lightweight websites and my love for blockchains shortly after.

I completed my Bachelor of Science in Business concentrating in Supply Chain Management and Analytics from VCU's School of Business and a Minor of Mathematics in May 2021. I made Dean's List in August 2020 and May 2021.

In October 2021, I discovered buildspace through Developer DAO.

The next pages show my previous projects, presentations, and things I've built.

While I don't keep them up-to-date, if you're interested (or looking for) my old portfolios, you can find them here:

In the past, I also co-founded [Lattice Supply](https://lattice.supply/).
