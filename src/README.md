# Intro

My name is Josh Stein. Welcome to my site!

I am currently a Solutions Engineer at Celestia Labs. I work on the Developer Relations team and focus on documentation, demos, and hackathons. I am also an editor for the Celestia Improvement Proposal process, which you can get involved in at [cips.celestia.org](https://cips.celestia.org) and [forum.celestia.org](https://forum.celestia.org).

If you're looking to get in touch, I am most active on X ([@JoshCStein](https://x.com/JoshCStein)) and Farcaster ([@jcs](https://warpcast.com/jcs)).
