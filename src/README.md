# Intro

My name is Josh Stein. Welcome to my site!

I am currently a Solutions Engineer at Celestia Labs. I work on the Developer Relations team and focus on documentation, demos, and hackathons. I am also an editor for the Celestia Improvement Proposal process, which you can get involved in at [forum.celestia.org](https://forum.celestia.org).

If you're looking to get in touch, I am most active on X ([@JoshCStein](https://x.com/JoshCStein)) and Farcaster ([@jcs](https://warpcast.com/jcs)).

My favorite thing about developer relations is documentation, which is why my portfolio is in an mdbook. I used to really only be a fan of fancy tools like [vocs](https://vocs.dev), [vitepress](https://vitepress.dev), and [nextrajs](https://nextra.site), but am keen to explore the simplicity of Rust's mdbook. I think it does everything that I want for a simple portfolio.
